### Crafts
#### Origami X-Wing
This was a combined designed from the two following videos:

  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ddd;">

The differences between the two folding techniques were actually quite minor as the base structure
is fundamentally the same, only differing in the detailing folds.

In short, some fine detailing folds on the laser cannons were omitted. On the other hand, I chose 
to include the cockpit fold from the more advanced design, Design 1, as it was important. As for
the anatomical correctness, I followed Design 2 for the body as it has the correct number (and
positioning) of thrust engines. See reference blueprint below:

#### Origami TIE Fighter and TIE Inceptor 
I followed these two following videos:

#### Oragami Results
After couple revisions and modifications, these are the final designs I decided upon:
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241118_170454.jpg" alt="Folded Aircrafts"></p>

I folded an equal ratio of light and dark aircrafts to even out the playing field as we are all
about that balance for the Friendsgiving theme.

To give these orgami aircrafts an extra pop, I added some detailing to each one with a white 
Gelly Roll (10) pen. I also threaded some fishing wire through each of them to hang onto the
ceiling hooks I set up from the previous years.

I poked holes in a different position along the aircraft's body for each X-Wing to give it a more 
dynamic orientation. As its center of gravity is by the cockpit area, I threaded some in front of
the cockpit to give an inclining feeling while hanging and contrarily, I threaded some behind the
cockpit to give a declining perspective.
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241118_185714.jpg" alt="Detailing"></p>

#### Diorama Assembly

Lastly, I added some additional details to finalize my dining room ceiling's diorama after 
realizing that not utilizing my half-sphere hanging lamp as the Death Star would be an otherwise 
regretible missed opportunity. After consulting some schematics, I decided I can draw out the
docking bay on some black strips of paper, which will be placed along the Death Star's equator.
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241118_200659.jpg" alt="Death Star Details"></p>

Of course, one cannot omit the Death Star's iconic superlaser, which I drew out and added later.

To bring all the diorama together, I utilized the Command Hooks from last year to fasten my fairy
lights in order to build together a universe. These lights had the perfect amount of twinkle to act
as constellations. Due to the positioning, I was able to form three different galaxy groups, 
utilizing five strings of fairy lights. I placed the toggles close together as this will optimize
the number of times I have to climb up the chair to turn on each string of fairy lights.

Putting all this together, here are the final results, which I am most proud of to share:

<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241124_003725.jpg" alt="Diorama"></p>

#### Toy Models
My dad kept a metal diecast model of the Naboo N-1 Starfighter that he bought for me back in 1999 
at Toys"R"Us. Surprised he kept it, I decided to finish the build it and place it up in the dining
area.

### Wall Art
Reusing the bulletin board from last year's event, I printed out and posted various interesting
Galactic Empire schematics, which I was able to find high-res images of online. It seemed fitting
to include elements of the dark side with the overarching gloom of the Death Star centerpiece.

I figured that these would be interesting to look at in case some people were not engaged in
conversation and wanted to look at.
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241124_002847.jpg" alt="Bulletin Board"></p>

Coincidentally, I also had a poster of a Japanese Lord Vader version I purchased earlier the same
year at a local shop, Legends.
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241124_002825.jpg" alt="Bulletin Board"></p>

As is customary for my themed parties, the (sometimes - \*cough\* Alice \*cough\*) overlooked but obligatory aspect of 
bathroom decorations are a quintessential embrace of selected setting. Thus, I once again printed 
and posted the following entertaining signs:
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-24/20241128_184045.jpg" alt="Bathroom Stormtrooper"></p>

### Appetizer: C-Wings vs. TIE Fighters
AKA Thai Glazed Chicken Wings. Thought the punny name had a nice _kick_ to it.

Referenced Recipes:

- [https://cafedelites.com/sticky-thai-chicken-wings-recipe/](https://cafedelites.com/sticky-thai-chicken-wings-recipe/)

Tips:
- Bake the chicken skin side down first so when you flip it during the halfway point, it will 
provide a better (although still subtle) crisp.
- Use a cooking rack for even cooking and easier cleanup.

Modifications:
- I opted to use honey instead of regular sugar, which does change the taste profile of the 
resulting chicken wings. Since honey has a stronger and unique taste, it takes away a bit from 
the savory spectrum.
- I also opted to marinate the wings for about half a day so the flavors seep into the wings 
better.

Notes:
- I actually did three takes (thighs, party wings, and drumsticks) on this but found that the party
wings best captured the flavors.
- Ideally, I would use jidori chicken but any air-chilled chicken works as the taste is better in 
my opinion.

### Main: Endor Harvest
Referenced Recipes:
- Dressing: [https://www.loveandlemons.com/balsamic-vinaigrette/](https://www.loveandlemons.com/balsamic-vinaigrette/)
- Salad: [https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/autumn-harvest-honeycrisp-apple-and-feta-salad/](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/autumn-harvest-honeycrisp-apple-and-feta-salad/)

Full Ingredient List:
- "Sweet green mix"
- Various apples
- Roasted nuts/seeds
  - Pecans
  - Honey
  - Cinnamon
  - Sunflower seeds
- Other toppings
  - Dried beet chips
  - Pomegranates
  - Feta (optional)
- Dressing
  - Balsamic vinegar
  - Olive oil
  - Dijon mustard
  - Salt
  - Pepper

Notes:
- It was a major hit (in my opinion) and a wonderful suggestion/find from Lisa last year, so that 
is why I decided to make another variant of it this year. I did sub a lot of the ingredients from 
the referenced recipe (honey for maple syrup, sunflower seeds for pumpkin seeds, various apples 
for honeycrisp apples).
- Seasonal ingredients always taste better, especially for salads. The sweet salad mix from the 
Saratoga Farmers' Market was the star of the show.
- There a slightly more emphasis on the sweeter notes on this salad.
- Honestly, as with any cooking (or assembly), there's no "right" way of making an autumn salad. I 
just played around with textures, flavors, and taste profiles.
- The dried beet chips from Sprouts as a topping in my opinion really additionally amped it up.

### Main: Wookie Wild Stew
Referenced Recipes:
- [https://www.spendwithpennies.com/beef-stew-recipe/](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/beef-stew-recipe/)

Notes:
- I felt like adding pan-seared mushrooms once the stew is finished cooking gave it a better 
texture.
- I did not like the cuts offered at the grocery store for beef stew due to the overall unevenness 
of the cuts. Instead, I opted on buying a London broil cut and cutting that up into cubes instead.
- Although not explicitly noted in the recipe (perhaps due to an experience reason), I explicitly 
chose and cut ingredients so they are of uniform sizing as it's more "pleasing" to eat. Therefore, 
I cubed up the beef a little larger to accomodate for shrinkage, halved baby carrots, baby dutch
yellow potatoes, and mushrooms, and finally, cut the celery to approximate length.
- Instead of cooking it in a dutch oven, I used the pressure cook setting on my Instant Pot to 
soften the beef. However, as a result of this, I ended up with a more liquidy consistency despite 
adding more of the cornstarch slurry.
- Used frozen peas instead of canned peas (ew).

that I attended as a guest.

Full Ingredient List:
- Sprout's Mulling Spice
- Apple juice

Notes:
- Served warm.

### Star Wars Intro
My initial idea was to reuse the hero parallax. Using CSS and JS, the intro scrolling will be
controlled by the amount scrolled.

Instead, I opted for a [pure CSS implementation](https://polarnotion.github.io/starwarsintro/)
and only customized the positionings and animation configurations. I swapped the classic static
background for one that moves in the opposite direction of the scrolling, creating a more dyanmic 
effect. On the computer, the background gif is stretched out, inadvertently giving it a 1977s feel.

As of the time of writing, ChatGPT recently enabled (on August 8, 2024) the ability to generate
images with DALL-E for the free tier. ChatGPT consistently provided oversimplified outputs when
trying to generate a simple stars gif background with a wide (1792x1024) resolution. Because of 
the three image per day limitations, I did not continue to pursue this path.

### AI Generated Images
Images were generated at [hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai/ai-image-generator/create") with 
**Watercolor 3** style. Like many AI image generators, it struggles with eyes, hands, and 
equipment.

As a result of not submitting any reference images for privacy concerns, the characters generated
by the tool exhibit facial likeliness. In order to diversify the roster, I opted to cover up parts
of the face with eyewear and masks.
